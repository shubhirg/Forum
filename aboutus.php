<p align="justify">Our mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. A vast amount of the knowledge that would be valuable to many people is currently only available to a few — either locked in people’s heads, or only accessible to select groups. We want to connect the people who have knowledge to the people who need it, to bring together people with different perspectives and ideas so they can understand each other better, and to empower everyone to share their knowledge for the benefit to others.</p>
